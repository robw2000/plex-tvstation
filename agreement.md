# Trial Separation: Boundaries and Expectations

This document is intended to create clarity, reduce confusion, and ensure mutual respect during a period of trial separation. It is not a legal contract but a mutually agreed-upon framework. This is not a legal separation or divorce, but a temporary arrangement made by mutual consent.


### 1. Purpose

The purpose of this trial separation is to create space for honest reflection, individual healing, and mutual clarity. It is not a step taken in anger, but one taken to reduce ongoing harm and assess the viability of the relationship. Each partner is encouraged to seek individual therapy and support during this time.

The goal is to determine—through clarity rather than conflict—whether the marriage can be restored in a healthy and meaningful way, or whether it would be healthier for both partners to part ways.

### 2. Emotional Boundaries

* We are no longer functioning as romantic or emotional partners.
* There are no expectations for intimacy, affection, or daily emotional check-ins.
* Each person may pursue individual therapy and emotional support outside the relationship.
* Communication should be respectful and limited to household logistics unless mutually agreed otherwise.

### 3. Duration

The trial separation will begin in **mid-May** and continue through **mid-August** (before the fall semester begins). The goal is to have three key check-in points:

* **Session 1** (mid-May): Discuss and agree on this plan — ideally with Kelly present.
* **Session 2** (around July 1st): Midpoint check-in.
* **Session 3** (early to mid-August): Final check-in to determine next steps.

### 4. Financial Responsibilities

We will maintain the current financial structure during the trial separation:

* All income continues to be deposited into the shared account.
* Each person receives a monthly allowance to cover personal expenses, groceries, and home needs.
* Any leftover funds from the allowance are considered personal spending money.

**Alternative Option:** Operate under a roommate-style model:

* Becca would pay rent to Robee in the amount of $\_\_\_\_\_\_ per month.
* Shared expenses (utilities, internet, household supplies, etc.) would be split as follows:

  * Robee: \_\_\_%
  * Becca: \_\_\_%
* Groceries may be separate or split; arrangements should be clear and consistent.
* Finances for discretionary spending would no longer be combined.
* Debt responsibilities would be divided equitably and documented as needed.

Either option should be agreed upon during the initial check-in.

### 5. Living Arrangements

* Both partners may continue residing in the same house.
* Each person has their own private living space (e.g., bedrooms).
* Shared spaces (kitchen, laundry, etc.) will be treated with mutual respect.
* Respect for each other’s space, sleep, and autonomy is essential.
* Shared spaces should not be used to intentionally disrupt or provoke.

### 6. Communication

* Keep communication respectful and to the point.
* Avoid arguments or repeated rehashing of past events.
* Limit emotionally heavy conversations to scheduled check-ins or therapy sessions unless mutually agreed upon.

### 7. External Relationships and Privacy

* Respect each other’s privacy.
* Do not intrude on or monitor each other’s personal routines unless directly relevant to shared responsibilities (finances, Belle, the dogs).
* Personal matters involving the separation should not be shared with mutual friends or family members (e.g., parents, siblings) without first discussing it with the other person.
* Robee does **not** intend to pursue romantic relationships during this separation. If Becca wishes to, this can be discussed before altering this agreement.

### 8. Counseling and Check-ins

* Both partners are encouraged to attend individual therapy during the separation.
* Robee recommends three scheduled check-ins:

  * **Mid-May** (with Kelly) to launch the plan.
  * **July 1st** (optional with Kelly).
  * **Early August** to review the separation and decide on future steps.

### 9. Shared Responsibilities

* Household chores and dog care will be split reasonably and fairly.
* Each partner is responsible for their own personal needs (laundry, space cleanliness, etc.)
* Shared responsibilities regarding Belle will continue based on availability and mutual agreement.

### 10. Personal Autonomy

* Each person is responsible for their own time, energy, healing, and personal growth.
* Decisions about health, hobbies, spiritual life, and friendships are made independently.

This document is a living agreement and can be updated if both parties agree. The primary goal is space, clarity, and emotional safety for both people.
