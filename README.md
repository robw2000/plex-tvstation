## Configuration and Additional Files

The application uses several additional files for configuration and managing media preferences:

- **local_config.json**
  - Description: This file contains local configuration settings for the application. It is used to customize the behavior of the scripts, such as specifying paths, user preferences, and other settings that need to be adjusted for the local environment.
  - Fields:
    - **tvShowLimit**: Specifies the maximum number of TV shows to be considered or processed at a time. Default is 8.
    - **defaultRewatchDelay**: Defines the default delay period before a movie or TV show can be rewatched.
      - **movies**: The delay for movies, set to "180 days".
      - **tv**: The delay for TV shows, set to "90 days".
    - **excludedSlugs**: A list of slugs (unique identifiers for media content) that should be excluded from processing.
    - **movieSeriesSlugs**: A list of slugs representing movie series that are grouped together.
    - **restrictedPlayMonths**: Specifies certain months during which specific themes or categories of media are restricted.
    - **metadata**: An array of objects, each containing metadata for specific TV shows.
      - **slug**: The unique identifier for the TV show.
      - **rewatchDelay**: The specific rewatch delay for the show, overriding the default if necessary.
      - **alwaysInclude**: A boolean indicating whether the show should always be included in processing, regardless of other settings.

- **movie_wishlist.txt**
  - Description: A text file that lists movies you wish to add to your Plex library. Each line in the file represents a movie title that the application will track or notify you about when it becomes available.

- **tv_wishlist.txt**
  - Description: Similar to `movie_wishlist.txt`, this file contains a list of TV shows you are interested in. The application uses this list to monitor and manage TV show availability and additions to your library.

Ensure these files are correctly configured and placed in the appropriate directory for the application to function as expected.
